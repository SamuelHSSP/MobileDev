# Mobile App Development with Python
With this repository, you can see the application of Python in mobile applications development.
Two technologies in use here are Kivy and KivyMD.
Kivy allows you to build cross-platform apps with just slight changes. That means you can build an app for desktop, and deploy the same app for other platforms such as iOS and Android.
## Quickstart
It's time to get started building mobile apps with the programming language you love!
Follow the instructions below to set up Kivy and KivyMD on your computer.
### Installation
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your computer, then copy and run the following commands, on your terminal, one after the other.
The first one installs the latest version of Kivy from pypi.org:

```pip install Kivy```

The final command installs KivyMD, which you should only install after installing Kivy, else it wouldn't work.

```pip install kivymd```

If you wish to install the latest version of KivyMD, which is not yet available on PyPI, clone the repository using Pip and Git, as shown below:

```pip install git+https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD.git```

*Note:* Git has to be installed on your device before you run the command above.
